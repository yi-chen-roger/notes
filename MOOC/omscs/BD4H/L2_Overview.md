## 4. Predictive Modeling Quiz
Let's try to estimate what percentage of people with Epilepsy in the U.S responded to treatment...
- With in the first 2 years of treatment    32%
- Between 2-5 years of treatment    24%
- Continue to suffer after 5 years 44%


## 5. Predictive Modeling Challenges
- so much data!
- so many models!
